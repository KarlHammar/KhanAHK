# KhanAHK
This is a script that allows for faster workflow when translating KhanAcademy to various languages in the translation portal. It currently allows you to use hotkeys for:
* Upvoting top suggestion
* Downvoting top suggestion
* Save string
* Go to next string (even if approved or translated)
* Go to previous string (even if approved or translated)
This is done by 'ImageSearch', which means you will need to take screenshots of respective elements and put them in a /pictures folder. You will also need to adjust searchboxes, treshhold values etc. depending on your setup. Guide not currently available.
